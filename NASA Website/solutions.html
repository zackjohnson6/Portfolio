<h2> Solutions to Slowing and Stopping Climate Change </h2>
<p>There is no catch-all solution to mitigating climate change. And while there are things you can do on an individual level, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Driving an electric vehicle</li>
<li>recycling and reusing plastic products</li>
<li>installing solar panels on your home</li>
</ul>

<p>the greatest changes will need to come from the corporate and governmental levels.</p>

<h3><i>Legislation</i></h3>

    “Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988,” (Riley, 2017). The ability of these companies to produce so much pollution is the direct result of a lack of government oversight on their emissions.<br><br>
    Massive reductions in carbon emissions from these companies will not occur out of the goodness of their hearts, but rather through government legislation and enforcement of climate policies. We must encourage our governments to enact these policies and ensure they are enforced to order to have any chance of lessening the impact of climate change.   
 </p>

<h3><i>Renewable and Clean Energy</i></h3>
<p>
    Fossil fuels account for a considerable portion of CO2 emissions. The reduction of use of fossil fuels and the switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power is a key step to slowing climate change and global warming.<br><br>
    There are also clean non-renewable energy sources, such as nuclear power. Nuclear power “produces energy via nuclear fission rather than chemical burning, it generates baseload electricity with no output of carbon,” and they are extremely efficient with “…nuclear power plants… had an average capacity factor of 92.3 percent, meaning they operated at full power on 336 out of 365 days per year,” (Rhodes et al.). If we as a society are able to meet our energy needs without having to burn and consume harmful, CO2 producing products like oil and coal, we can make great strides in our fight against climate change.
