<h2> Impact of Climate Change and a Warming World </h2>
<p>The impact and effects of climate change worldwide will be numerous, but we will focus on a select few here.</p>

<h3><i>Rising Sea Levels</i></h3>
<p>As the Earth warms, the polar ice caps and other sea ice will melt at an increasing rate. This melting will cause extreme amounts of water to be added to the oceans, increasing sea levels by 1-8 feet by 2100 (2021). Rising sea levels will cause mass flooding in coastal areas, displacing untold millions of people from their homes, and burying entire cities underwater. </p>

<h3><i>Increased Drought and More Frequent Heatwaves</i></h3>

<p>According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, “Warmer temperatures enhance evaporation, which reduces surface water and dries out soils and vegetation. This makes periods with low precipitation drier than they would be in cooler conditions,” (2021).</p><br>
<p>Furthermore, global warming increases the variability of precipitation, leading to increased periods of both extreme drought and extreme precipitation (2021). Regions that are already dry will get drier, which can lead to a humanitarian crisis that we would also see with rising sea levels; displaced persons and loss of crop, potentially leading to famine.</p>

<h3><i>More Intense Weather Events</i></h3>
<p>Weather events, namely hurricanes, will continue to become more frequent and more powerful as the climate continues to change. According to NASA, “a string of nine years without a major hurricane landfall in the U.S. is likely to come along only once every 177 years,” (2021), meaning that it is becoming increasingly rare to go any stretch of time without seeing a major hurricane occur. These strengthening hurricanes will continue to cause untold destruction and displace people from affected communities.</p>
