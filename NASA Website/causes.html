<h2> Causes of Climate Change </h2>
<p>The main cause of climate change and a warming planet is the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (European Commission). According to the European Commission, carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by human activity is the largest contributor to climate change and global warming (n.d.).<br><br>
    Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, CO2 concentrations have “risen to 48% above its pre-industrial level (before 1750),” (European Commission), and this concentration is only increasing, leading to increased warming of the planet. CO2 emissions are mainly caused by the burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and deforestation. (European Commission).</p>

<h3><i>Fossil Fuels</i></h3>

<p>Fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, are main energy sources around the world. China primarily uses coal to power their country, which in turn causes that nation to contribute 30% of the entire world’s CO2 emissions (Worldometer). Fossil fuels are also major energy sources in manufacturing.</p><br><br>

<p>Oil is a primary fuel used in creating plastics, which contributes a double does of pollution; not only does CO2 get released into the atmosphere from plastic manufacturing, but the discarded plastics often end up in natural areas, such as waterways and oceans.</p>

<h3><i>Deforestation</i></h3>
<p>Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and release oxygen through photosynthesis. But when trees are cut down through massive deforestation efforts, this absorption is greatly diminished. Furthermore, as the trees are being cut, “the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect,” (European Commission).</p>
