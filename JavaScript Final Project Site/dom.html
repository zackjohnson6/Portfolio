            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            The Chicago Bears as we know them today were formed in 1920 in Decatur, Illinois. They were originally named the Decatur Staleys. George Halas was hired to be the first coach, and was also a player on the team. Full control of the team was turned over to Halas in 1921, at which time the team relocated to Chicago. In 1922, Halas changed the name from the Staleys to the Bears. The team would go on to win league championships in 1921, 1932, and 1933.
            </p>
      
        <h2>The 1940's and the Monsters of the Midway</h2>
        <p>
            The Bears of the 40`s found great success. Led by quarterback Sid Luckman, the team won the NFL championship in 1940, `41, `43, and `46. During this time, the Bears adopted the moniker “Monsters of the Midway,” which remains a team nickname to present day. In the 1940 NFL Championship game, the Bears defeated the Washington Redskins by a score of 73-0, which remains an NFL record for a lopsided victory.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Lean Years: 1950's to 1980's</h2>
        <p>After great early success, the Bears fell on hard times. Between 1947 and 1985, the Bears only won a single championship, in 1963. The team would only make the playoffs 5 times in 35 seasons after their 1946 championship. Hall of Fame players such as Gale Sayers and Dick Butkus would play during this time, but could not achieve the success of earlier teams.
            </p>

        <h2>Return to Glory</h2>
        <p>
        The Bears had drafted future Hall of Famer Walter Payton in 1975, whose play helped spur the Bears to success. In 1982, Mike Ditka was hired as the head coach of the Bears; After missing the playoffs in Ditka`s first two seasons, the Bears reached the conference championship game in 1984. In 1985, behind a defense considered by some to be the greatest of all-time, the Bears finished the regular season with a 15-1 record, best in the NFL. They would go on to defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX, 46-10. This Marked the Bears` first championship win since 1946.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Lean Years, Pt. 2: 1986-2005</h2>
        <p>
            After winning Super Bowl XX, the Bears would be a consistent playoff team from 1986-1994, with 6 playoff appearances in 9 seasons. Performance dropped off in the mid-90`s to early 2000`s, with only 3 playoff appearances between 1994 and 2005. Lovie Smith would be hired in 2004, which sparked a return to success.

        </p>

        <h2>Success with Lovie Smith, 2004-2012</h2>
        Under head coach Lovie Smith, the Bears reached the playoffs 3 times. The Bears reached Super Bowl XLI in 2006, but were defeated by the Indianapolis Colts. Under Smith, the Bears achieved a regular season record of 81-63, but could not replicate regular season success in the playoffs; the team went 3-3 in the playoffs in 8 years under Smith.

        <h2>Post Smith Era to Present: 2012-2021</h2>
        <p>Since firing Lovie Smith in 2012, the Bears have had 4 head coaches: Marc Trestman, John Fox, Matt Nagy, and current coach Matt Eberflus. Since 2006, the Bears have only reached the postseason 3 times, in 2010, 2018, and 2020. In 2021, the Bears drafted quarterback Justin Fields 11th overall, bringing hope of future success to a struggling franchise.
