<!--Made this section it's own class to as not to mess with other paragraphs in the site.-->
<div class="home">
<p>- On the <i>Hall of Famers</i> page, I used a very basic array to list the names of the former Bears players that have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. I then used  "getElementById" and "innerHTML" to output the array onto the page. You can view this by clicking <a href="arrays.html">here.</a></p>

<p>- The <i>Quick Facts</i> page utilizes functions to output the values for dates and numbers on the page. These are pretty basic functions, mostly using addition and subtraction, to output the number of total victories the Bears have, the year they were founded, etc. The numbers are simply displayed, but if the functions were not working correctly, the spaces they are in would be blank, or have an "undefined" message. You can view the page <a href="functions.html">here.</a></p>

<p>- Within the page <i>A Short History</i>, I briefly cover the history of the Chicago Bears franchise. By using DOM APIs, I had my script determine the name of my page, how many paragraphs are within the page, and how many headings I used. This information is output and displayed on the bottom of the page underneath the main text. To go this page, click <a href="dom.html">here.</a></p>

<p>The <i>Trivia</i> page was created by using events. The trivia questions go along with the photos on the page, and each photo has a different event associated with it to display the answer. While one photo needs to be clicked, another will need to be hovered over. Try to answer some Bears trivia <a href="events.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Finally, the <i>Photos</i> page uses a javascript slide show. The code was written using JQuery, so I needed to connect my page to Google's JQuery library to ensure functionality. The slideshow scrolls through a few photos of Bears related images on a specific interval which is set using the script. Check out the pictures <a href="jquery.html">here.</a></p>
